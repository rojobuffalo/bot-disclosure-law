# Bot Disclosure Law

This is an idea for a law that I think should exist to protect humans: a law that requires all bots to be labeled as bots. Bot activity should always be labeled so that humans can easily distinguish it from human activity. Any service which stores user accounts, must ensure that any account owned or accessed by a bot program must have a user name that ends in 'bot'. All messages, comments, and audio clips must be labeled with the bot name. User activity statistics like views, upvotes, downvotes, and retweets must clearly designate the portion that is bots or not include bot activity in those statistics. Generative art, music, and videos must be clearly attributed with the bot name.

## Terminology

Bot: fake user activity; a program that could be mistaken for a human or human behavior  
Label: username ends in 'bot' and is displayed at all times  
Activity: something a human does that a bot may also do, including
- Natural language text
- Natural language voice
- Video views
- Upvotes
- Downvotes
- Retweets
- Generative art
- Auction bidding

## Justification

Humans spend a lot of time these days accessing information and networks with many other humans who they do not know personally. In many cases it is impossible to tell if user activity is from actual people or bot programs. Bot programs can be scaled up almost without limit, which means our communication networks and normal human intuitions about the other humans we share this planet with are vulnerable to manipulation.

## Detecting violations

Monitoring user activity for terms of service violations is already something companies do. Strategies for moderating content vary widely. Detecting bots that are pretending to be people is not easy and will likely get more difficult as we advance into the future. There is still a lot of work to be done to come up with solutions for detecting violations of the bot disclosure law.

## Penalties

Any bot that is proven to be acting without an appropriate label should be immediately shut down. Humans who may be affected by having seen content that the bot posted should be notified of the mislabeled activity.
