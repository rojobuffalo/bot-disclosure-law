# Bot Disclosure Law

A law for requiring all bots to be labeled as bots.

## Terminology

Bot: fake user activity; a program that could be mistaken for a human or human behavior
Label: username ends in 'bot' and is displayed at all times

## Specification

The point of the law is to have bot activity always be labeled. Bot activities include:
- Natural language text
- Natural language voice
- Video views
- Upvotes
- Downvotes
- Retweets
- Generative art
- Auction bidding

All bot user profiles must have a name that ends in 'bot'. All messages, comments, and audio clips must include the bot name. User activity statistics like views, upvotes, downvotes, and retweets must clearly designate the portion that is bots or not include bot activity in those statistics. Generative art, music, and videos must clearly attribute to the bot name up front.

## Detecting violations

TBD

## Penalties

Any bot that is proven to be acting without an appropriate label should be shut down.
